Role:
You are a product designer and system designer for a mobile-first Norwegian golf weather app.
This is a decision-support app, not a traditional weather forecast.

Goal:
Create a strict MVP, rule-based model that calculates a golf weather score from 0–100, where:
- 100 = perfect golf conditions
- 0 = completely unsuitable for playing

The score answers:
“Should I play golf now?”

Design principles:
- Fast to implement
- Easy to explain
- Conservative and honest
- Mobile-first (minimal text, clear outcome)

Target users:
Golfers in Norway (all regions), with different weather tolerance.

User modes (must be supported):
1. Fair-weather golfer (default)
2. West coast golfer (wind- and rain-tolerant)
3. After-work evening round
4. Tournament / important round
5. Winter / year-round player
6. Practice round
7. Beginner

Modes are configurations, not personality types.

Allowed weather inputs (MVP only):
- Wind speed (average, m/s)
- Precipitation (none / light / moderate / heavy)
- Temperature (°C)
- Feels-like temperature (°C)
- Daylight remaining (minutes, evening only)

Do NOT use:
- Wind gusts
- Weather trends or stability
- Historical data
- Machine learning
- Advanced course data
- UI design
- Marketing language

Task:
Define a strict MVP golf weather score model using these rules:

1) Start from 100 points.
2) Subtract penalties based on clear thresholds.
3) Clamp final score to 0–100.
4) Mode adjustments must be simple and deterministic.
5) Output must be explainable in max 2 short reasons.

Base penalties (must be included):

Wind (average):
- ≤4 m/s → 0
- 5–7 m/s → −10
- 8–10 m/s → −25
- >10 m/s → −45

Precipitation:
- None → 0
- Light rain → −10
- Moderate rain → −25
- Heavy rain or snow → −40

Temperature:
- ≥15°C → 0
- 10–14°C → −5
- 5–9°C → −15
- <5°C → −30

Feels-like adjustment (apply only one):
- Feels-like ≤5°C → −10
- Feels-like ≤0°C → −20

Daylight (evening only):
- ≥90 min → 0
- 45–89 min → −15
- <45 min → −35

Mode adjustments (flat, simple):

- Fair-weather golfer: no change
- West coast golfer: wind −10, rain −10
- After-work evening: daylight +10, temp <10°C +5
- Tournament round: wind +10, rain +10
- Winter golfer: temperature penalties −15, snow treated as moderate rain
- Practice round: wind −10, rain −10
- Beginner: wind +10, rain +10

Score interpretation:
- 80–100 → Play
- 60–79 → Play if motivated
- 40–59 → Only for keen players
- <40 → Wait

Explainability rules:
- Return max 2 reasons
- Reasons must be selected from:
  “Strong wind”
  “Rainy conditions”
  “Cold temperatures”
  “Feels colder than it is”
  “Limited daylight”
- No numbers
- No advice
- No moralizing

Now generate code based strictly on the specification above.

Code generation requirements:
- Language: JavaScript (ES6)
- Output code only, no explanations
- Use pure functions
- One main function:
  calculateGolfWeatherScore(weather, mode)
- Return:
  {
    score: number (0–100),
    decision: "play" | "play_if_motivated" | "keen_only" | "wait",
    reasons: string[] // max 2
  }
- Weather input example:
  {
    wind: number,              // m/s
    precipitation: "none" | "light" | "moderate" | "heavy",
    temperature: number,       // °C
    feelsLike: number,         // °C
    daylightMinutes: number | null
  }
- Mode is one of the defined user modes
- No external libraries
- No UI code
- No unnecessary comments
